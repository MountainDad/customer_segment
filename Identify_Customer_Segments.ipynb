    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

    "\n",

    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. You will use this information to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, load in the demographics data for the general population into a pandas DataFrame, and do the same for the feature attributes summary. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project: they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so you'll need an additional argument in your [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the main dataset, it may take some time for it to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the dataset is loaded, it's recommended that you take a little bit of time just browsing the general structure of the dataset and feature summary file. You'll be getting deep into the innards of the cleaning in the first major step of the project, so gaining some general familiarity can help you get your bearings."

This discrepancy often arises because the missing values can introduce biases or obscure important patterns within the data. As a result, relying on datasets with numerous missing values can lead to flawed analyses and incorrect predictions. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of predictive models, it is generally advisable to use datasets that have minimal or no missing values. By doing so, the integrity of the data is preserved, and the models built from such data are more likely to produce valid and actionable insights."

So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [SimpleImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",

    "I encountered issues while running the aforementioned three code blocks in my Workspace, frequently receiving a \"Kernel Dead\" error. This persistent problem hindered the execution and testing of the code. Despite these technical difficulties, I formulated predictions based on the code and a comparative analysis of clusters 14 and 8. I anticipated an overrepresentation in one of the clusters, with cluster 8 expected to show an underrepresentation. These predictions were guided by the data's structure and previous insights, suggesting a significant disparity between these clusters. Moving forward, resolving the kernel error is crucial to validate these predictions and ensure the accuracy of the clustering analysis."

    "> Congratulations on making it this far in the project! Before you finish, make sure to check through the entire notebook from top to bottom to make sure that your analysis follows a logical flow and all of your findings are documented in **Discussion** cells. Once you've checked over all of your work, you should export the notebook as an HTML document to submit for evaluation. You can do this from the menu, navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. You will submit both that document and this notebook for your project submission."
